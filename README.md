## Project Overview

The Spotify Clone project aims to provide a visually and functionally similar experience to the official Spotify web player. This implementation focuses on the front-end aspects, utilizing HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and FontAwesome for icons. The design includes a sidebar for navigation, a main content area for displaying playlists and trending music, and a persistent music player at the bottom.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Sidebar**: Includes options for Home and Search functionalities, with a visually appealing design that adjusts to user interactions.
- **User Library Management**: A dedicated section for displaying the user's playlists and podcasts, with options to create new playlists and browse podcasts.
- **Music Display Cards**: Sections for recently played, trending music, and featured charts, each displaying music cards with album artwork and information.
- **Persistent Music Player**: A fixed music player at the bottom of the screen, providing playback controls such as play/pause, forward, and backward, along with volume control.
